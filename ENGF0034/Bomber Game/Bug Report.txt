-- Bug 1 --

Summary: If a bomb goes off the screen (does not hit a building), no extra bombs can be dropped

What should happen: The player should be able to drop more bombs if they didnt hit a building

How to reproduce: Drop a bomb in between buildings

How to fix: Added a cleanup function for the bomb that deletes itself and resets its falling and drawn states. Call this function if the bomb goes off the canvas screen or it hits a building.


-- Bug 2 --

Summary: If the plane successfully crosses the canvas, it is redrawn at an offset to the right of the canvas. This makes it impossible to hit the furthest right building.

What should happen: The plane should fly onto the canvas, rather than appearing on the canvas immediatly.

How to reproduce: Launching the game and trying to hit the furthest building on the right.

How to fix: In the 'move' function of the Plane, add an offset of self.width. self.position.move(CANVAS_WIDTH, 40) changed to self.position.move(CANVAS_WIDTH + self.width, 40).
