-- Bug 1 --

Summary: If a bomb goes off the screen (does not hit a building), no extra bombs can be dropped

What should happen: The player should be able to drop more bombs if they didnt hit a building

How to reproduce: Drop a bomb in between buildings

How to fix: Added a cleanup function for the bomb that deletes itself and resets its falling and drawn states. Call this function if the bomb goes off the canvas screen or it hits a building.
